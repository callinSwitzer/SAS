1.  **More Candy -- a final SAS exercise**

Look at the Candy SAS dataset.  Suppose that we want to study
only the subset consisting of companies (brands) that have
more than two products (names).  Write SAS code that removes
automatically all companies with two or less products.

2.  Wrap up reading Cody & Smith.  Finish assigned SAS exercises.

3.  Prepare for your oral presentation on your SAS project.
Ask questions, by all means!

4.  **More about PROC SQL -- a final SAS reading**

Read more about PROC SQL at

http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/library/nesug99/bt082.pdf

and try using it on, for example, our bank employee dataset.*/

* first, download the candy.sas7bdat data;

* look at data; 
LIBNAME myplace "C:\Users\cswitzer\Desktop";

PROC CONTENTS DATA=myplace.candy VARNUM;
RUN;

/* Sort by brand */
PROC SORT DATA = MYPLACE.CANDY; 
	BY brand;
RUN; 
 
/*output duplicate dataset*/
DATA myplace.candyDuplicates;
	SET MYPLACE.CANDY;
	BY brand;
	/* if the brand is not in the dataset only once, then output it to the duplicate file*/
	IF ^(first.brand and last.brand) THEN OUTPUT myplace.candyDuplicates;
RUN;
